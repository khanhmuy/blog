# hello 🌸ヾ(•ω•`)o

> ain't no way hmuy's putting their (relatively) expensive keebs to use

i'm hmuy (he/they | en/vi), your average mf with unmonitored internet access since 4. probably not a good thing to say out loud.

some of my interests are music, [photography](https://instagram.com/hmuy0608), motorsport (F1), reading mangas, watching animes and some gaming (i utterly suck at all of them though). check out my [homepage](https://hmuy.live) as well.

anyways, this is where i'll put my blogs and writings, mostly for my own enjoyment (as if anyone else is reading this lmao).

i feel like social media is getting a bit too much for me now, and being [a country mouse forced to the city](https://anilist.co/anime/171627/Chainsaw-Man-Rezehen/) without a hole to yell to, this is where i'm gonna be putting out some "long-ish" stuff. hopefully. probably. i don't know. i hadn't put out anything on this for a year, lol.

blog made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) + [Bear Blog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/) theme, and some [catppuccin-mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) colors.
