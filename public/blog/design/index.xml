      <description>introduction okay my ahh capped I haven&amp;rsquo;t been using Material You for that long lmao.&#xA;This is just my thoughts on what is in my opinion, the biggest change to Android since their own switch to Material Design back in 2014. Although, I believe this is much more than just a design language, it&amp;rsquo;s about the evolution of one of our most important devices today - the smartphone.&#xA;backstory To me, a phone that I can&amp;rsquo;t customize to look, feel and function to my liking is not a phone I&amp;rsquo;d enjoy using for more than a couple of hours, let along every single day.</description>
