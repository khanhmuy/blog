      <description>Kimi to Tsuzuru Utakata - The Summer You Were There a review by hmuy.&#xA;introduction As much of a disorganized mess as I am, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d try to write something while going through the oven that is SEA summer, and having read quite a few mangas over the past year or so, here we are. Do note though that these are gonna be less of reviews than me just putting my inhoherent ramblings and feelings about a story out there lol.</description>
